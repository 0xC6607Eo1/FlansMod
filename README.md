Welcome to FlansMod rewrite github.

I'm 0xC6607Eo1, and I'm using this to create backups of the mod, this would help me check and update more easly.
and share with you.

# FOR DEVELOPERS #
Dear developers, I'm not using anything besides Forge and HexAPI.

Notes :
+ Turbo Model Thingy isnt supported now / later.
+ Nitro Model Thingy will be supported.
+ HexAPI comes installed

FAQ :
Question: What is HexAPI ?
Answer: HexAPI is basicly PlayerAPI that works with Forge. its custom made to not cause any bugs.

Question: Do you have permissions to rename the API and release it?
Answer: I'm not releasing the API. the API will only help us making everything work fine.

Question: So whats good the API? if its not going to get released.
Answer: I want to ask permissions to update API for Forge usage in Flan's Mod.

Question: How will you ask permissions, If its called HexAPI ?
Answer: HexAPI was only so I can easliy find and update the stuff for Forge, I'm going to change the name back If I get the permission to use it with Flan's Mod.

# FOR DEVELOPERS #

I have paused my mods to help Flan.

Greetings, 0xC6607Eo1.
